Description: mouse accessibility enhancements for the GNOME desktop
 This package contains a daemon and some panel applets to improve mouse
 usability on the GNOME desktop. These enhancements are:
 .
  * The possibility to click without a button
  * The ability to bring the context menu with a one-button mouse
    (like MacOS does)
  * An area to capture the mouse pointer until it is released with a
    pre-defined key combination.
